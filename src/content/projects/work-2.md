**Description**

<br>

Designed specifically for **mobile-first platforms**, this vertical motion ad promotes Lifeline Shop's seasonal giveaway to drive foot traffic.

<br>

The project utilizes Lifeline's signature blue branding mixed with festive elements—like animated string lights and kinetic typography—to create a sense of urgency. The animation hierarchy guides the viewer quickly from the **"$600 Prize"** hook to the **"Spend $25"** call-to-action, ensuring the message is clear even on small screens.
