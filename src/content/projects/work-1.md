**Description**

<br>

This short-form commercial focuses on revitalizing Tupperware's iconic **Eco Bottle** for a younger demographic.

<br>

I utilized a high-energy **magenta color scheme** to grab immediate attention, ensuring brand recognition within the first second. The composition blends lifestyle imagery with smooth motion graphics and kinetic text overlays—encouraging customers to _'Rediscover their favorites'_ and visit the store today.
